# What is Coposto?

COPOSTO is a collaborative peer-to-peer service that connects people who need to send something from one place to another with people going that way, anyway. Whether they are on the road, taking the train or traveling by other means, they can use their mobile phone to pick up and deliver, make some money and maybe save the environment as well. Fast, cheap and sustainable.
